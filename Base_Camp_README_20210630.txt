VARIABLES*
TIMESTAMP: Calendar date and time in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).
T_HMP: Sample hourly temperature (°C) from Vaisala HMP 155A-L5-PT sensor installed in a naturally ventilated 
METSPEC 14-plate solar radiation shield.
RH: Mean hourly relative humidity (%) from Vaisala HMP 155A-L5-PT sensor installed in a naturally ventilated 
METSPEC 14-plate solar radiation shield. Calculated with respect to ice when T_HMP < 0 °C.
PRESS: Mean hourly barometric pressure (hPa) from Vaisala PTB110 air pressure sensor.
PRECIP: Hourly precipitation total (mm) from OTT Pluvio2 1500 weighing precipitation gauge inside a Belfort 
double alter shield.

MISSING VALUES DENOTED BY -999

*PLEASE SEE TABLE 1 IN MATTHEWS ET AL. (2020) FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF SENSOR 
SPECIFICATIONS AND SAMPLING INTERVALS.

KNOWN ISSUES WITH AWS DATA (THROUGH 30 JUNE 2021)
1. Positive bias on T_HMP values during periods of calm wind and high solar radiation presumably due to limited 
ventilation of METSPEC 14-plate solar radiation shield.
